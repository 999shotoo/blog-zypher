# Welcome

This is my first blog post. I wanted to create a simple, classic space on the web where I can share my thoughts without all the noise.

## Why This Blog?

The web used to be simpler. Personal blogs were just HTML pages with text and maybe some simple styling. No tracking, no algorithms, just words on a screen.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Technology and programming
- Random thoughts and observations
- Things I'm learning
- Whatever else comes to mind

Thanks for stopping by.
